# :zap: Dissect: Visualise Skalpel Type-Error Slices

Dissect is a browser based visualisation tool built to help understand/fix type-errors in Standard ML programs.
It is built on top of output generated by [Skalpel](https://github.com/ultra-group/skalpel).

This project is being developed as part of a final year dissertation required for completion of a BSc (Hons) Computer Science Degree at Heriot-Watt University.

## Installing

`dissect` is just a simple web app, all you need to do is serve the files in this repo from the project root.

For example:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/CGA1123/dissect.git
$ cd dissect
$ python -m http.server 8000
```

You should then be able to go to your browser go to http://localhost:8000!

### Dependencies

`dissect` uses output from [`skalpel`](https://github.com/ultra-group/skalpel) as its data source for the visualisation.

If you want to generate visualisation output for your own Standard ML program you will need to have `skalpel` installed on your local machine.

Build instruction for skalpel can be found [here](https://github.com/ultra-group/skalpel/blob/new-output/BUILD.md).

**NOTE:**

Both this project & ultra-group/skalpel@new-output are under heavy development and subject big changes.
The JSON output for `skalpel` (and therefore input for `dissect`) has not yet been finalised.

At the moment output is generated using the following command `$ skalpel -d TEMP -b 1 <file.sml>`
