# :zap: Dissect: Visualise Skalpel Type-Error Slices

Dissect is a browser based visualisation tool built to help understand/fix type-errors in Standard ML programs.
It is built on top of output generated by [Skalpel](https://github.com/ultra-group/skalpel).

This project was developed as part of a final year dissertation required for completion of a BSc (Hons) Computer Science Degree at Heriot-Watt University.
